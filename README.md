## Features
- ### Real-Time Data Synchronization:
  **Ensures that users have the most up-to-date information at all times.** Firebase's real-time database was employed to ensure that users always have the most up-to-date 
  information. Whether it’s profile updates, preference changes, or messaging, all data is synced instantly across all user devices, providing a smooth and consistent 
  experience.
- ### User Authentication:
  **Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication.** Security and user trust are paramount. Roommatez uses Firebase Authentication to handle 
  user registration and login. The app supports email/password authentication with required email verification, ensuring that only verified users can access the platform. 
  We also provide a feature that allows users to stay logged in, so they don’t have to re-enter their credentials each time they open the app. This ensures that user data 
  is kept secure and access is managed reliably.
- ### Push Notifications:
  **Keeps users informed about important updates and messages.** Keeping users engaged and informed is crucial for the success of any mobile app. Push notifications are 
  used to alert users about new messages, roommate match suggestions, and other important updates. These notifications are delivered in real time, ensuring that users don’t 
  miss out on any critical information.
- ### In-App Messaging: Allows users to communicate directly within the app.
  The in-app messaging system is a standout feature of Roommatez, enabling users to communicate directly within the app. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:
  1. Real-Time Chat: Messages are delivered instantly, allowing for fluid and natural conversations. Firebase's real-time capabilities ensure that there is no noticeable    
     delay, making the messaging experience as smooth as any major social platform.
  2. User Interface: Designed in Figma, the chat interface is intuitive and user-friendly. It features easy-to-read message bubbles, timestamps, and user avatars to create       a personalized and engaging experience. The design prioritizes simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that users can easily navigate and use the messaging feature.
  3. Multimedia Support: The messaging system supports text, images, and even emojis, allowing users to express themselves fully. Future updates may include support for     
     voice notes, videos, and file sharing.
  4. Message Notifications: Users receive instant push notifications for new messages, ensuring they stay connected and responsive. Notifications include the sender's name       and a preview of the message content, providing context at a glance.
  5. Privacy & Security: All messages are encrypted, and user data is protected by Firebase’s robust security protocols. Only intended recipients can view messages,     
     ensuring that private conversations remain confidential.
- ### Preference-Based Filtering: Enhances roommate compatibility by matching users based on their preferences.
  Finding the right roommate is all about compatibility. Roommatez uses a sophisticated filtering system that matches users based on their preferences, such as sleep     
  schedules, study habits, cleanliness, and more. Future updates may include a combination of Firebase's real-time database and custom algorithms to provide users with the    best possible match suggestions.

## Agile Development & CI/CD
Throughout the development process, we employed agile methodologies to iterate quickly and efficiently. A CI/CD pipeline was set up to automate testing, building, and deployment, ensuring that the app is always in a deployable state.

## UI/UX Design
The user interface and experience were meticulously designed in Figma. The app features a clean and modern design, with a focus on usability and aesthetics. Key design elements include:
1. **Consistent Visual Language:** Colors, typography, and icons are used consistently throughout the app to create a cohesive visual experience.
2. **User-Centered Design:** User feedback was incorporated throughout the design process to ensure that the app meets the needs and expectations of its target audience.
3. **Responsive Design:** The UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal experience on both smartphones and tablets.
